# Unauthenticated Cache Purge

## Summary

Cache PURGE is a popular mechanism used by many software stacks to clear the app cache that resides on their backend servers (Redis, Nginx, Varnish, Cloudflare, etc). 
* Most services offering the PURGE functionality let users clear their own cache on specific paths or just purge all the cached content.
* Some PURGE mechanisms are not properly protected, and malicious actors can request a PURGE request for any resource, creating a cache invalidation.
* This often leads to increased bandwidth usage and degraded performance on the web app.
## Solution

- [x] Disallow cache purge for unauthenticated users.
