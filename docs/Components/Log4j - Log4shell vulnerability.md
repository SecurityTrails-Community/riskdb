# Log4Shell
## Summary
Log4j is a Java-based logging utility widely used as a dependency in a lot of popular frameworks,  including but not limited to Apache Hadoop, Struts2, and others.
The Log4Shell RCE vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute remote code on the affected versions of Apache Log4j in order to gain access to systems.

All versions from 2.0-alpha7 to 2.17.0, excluding 2.3.2 and 2.12.4 are affected by this vulnerability.

## Solution
!!! warning "Disabling the feature with log4j2.formatMsgNoLooups is not enough!"

â€‹    Some older posts on the internet state that it is enough to start the Java VM with a command line that disables the affected feature. This does **not** protect you against [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). 

- [x] Uprade to version 2.16.0 or later. *(recommended)*
- [x] Remove the class JndiLookup from the Java Classpath: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
